Great! Glad to hear the application is running.

Here is the updated API documentation based on the corrected code and the requirements discussed. This should help you test all the endpoints effectively using a tool like Postman or Insomnia.

Online Exam Portal - API Documentation (Updated)

Base URL: (Your running server, e.g., http://127.0.0.1:5000)

Authentication:

Most endpoints require a JSON Web Token (JWT).

Obtain the token via POST /auth/login.

Include the token in the Authorization header for subsequent requests:
Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_JWT_TOKEN>

Many endpoints also require specific roles (Admin, Teacher, Student) and for the user account to be verified. These requirements are noted for each endpoint.
