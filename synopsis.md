## Project Synopsis: AI-Enhanced Online Exam Portal for Colleges

**1. Project Title:** Online Exam Portal with AI-Powered Evaluation

**2. Introduction:**

The shift towards online education necessitates robust, secure, and efficient platforms for conducting assessments. Traditional examination methods often face challenges related to logistics, scalability, security, and timely evaluation, especially for subjective answers. This project proposes the development of a comprehensive Online Exam Portal specifically designed for the college environment. The portal aims to streamline the entire examination lifecycle – from creation and scheduling by faculty to participation by students and evaluation, including AI-assisted grading for subjective questions – providing a modern, integrated solution.

**3. Problem Statement:**

Colleges and educational institutions currently face several hurdles with both traditional and basic online examination systems:

*   **Inefficiency:** Manual creation, distribution, collection, and grading of exams are time-consuming for faculty.
*   **Evaluation Delay:** Grading subjective answers (short/long) is a bottleneck, delaying feedback to students.
*   **Scalability Issues:** Handling exams for large numbers of students simultaneously can be logistically challenging.
*   **Security Concerns:** Ensuring exam integrity, preventing cheating, and managing user authentication securely are critical.
*   **Lack of Centralization:** Often, exam creation, student participation, and result management occur on disparate or inadequate systems.
*   **Limited Question Types:** Some platforms lack flexibility in supporting varied question formats like detailed long answers alongside MCQs.

**4. Proposed Solution:**

The proposed solution is a dedicated web-based **Online Exam Portal** featuring distinct interfaces and functionalities for three user roles: **Admin**, **Teacher**, and **Student**.

*   **Teachers** can create and manage exams, define question types (MCQ, Short Answer, Long Answer) with specific parameters (marks, options, correct answers, word limits), and schedule exams.
*   **Students** can view available exams, participate within timed sessions using a user-friendly interface, and submit their responses.
*   **Admins** manage the system, verify user accounts (Teachers, Students), oversee the process, and have access to system-wide data and results.

A key innovation is the integration of **Google's Gemini 1.5 Flash AI model**. When triggered by an Admin, the system sends subjective student answers (Short/Long) to the AI for evaluation based on predefined criteria (relevance, accuracy, coherence, grammar, word count adherence). The AI returns suggested marks and textual feedback, which are stored and presented alongside results.

The system utilizes **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)** with custom claims for secure authentication and role-based authorization, ensuring users can only access appropriate features and data.

**5. Objectives:**

*   To develop a centralized, web-based platform for managing the entire online examination process.
*   To implement secure, role-based access control for Admin, Teacher, and Student users using JWT authentication.
*   To enable Teachers to create exams with a mix of question types: Multiple Choice (MCQ), Short Answer, and Long Answer.
*   To provide Students with a clear interface for viewing, taking, and submitting timed exams.
*   To integrate the Gemini 1.5 Flash AI model for automated evaluation of Short and Long Answer questions, providing marks and feedback.
*   To facilitate efficient user management, including Admin verification of Teacher and Student accounts.
*   To allow appropriate viewing of exam results and feedback tailored to each user role.
*   To build a scalable and maintainable application using modern web technologies (Angular & Flask).

**6. Scope:**

**In Scope:**

*   User Registration (Teacher, Student) and Admin Verification workflow.
*   JWT-based Login/Logout and session management.
*   Role-specific dashboards (basic statistics).
*   Exam Creation/Update/Deletion/Listing by Teachers.
*   Question Creation/Update/Deletion/Listing within exams (MCQ, Short Answer, Long Answer types).
*   Configuration of marks, options/correct answer (MCQ), word limits (Subjective).
*   Student view of available/active exams.
*   Timed exam-taking interface for students.
*   Student answer submission.
*   Admin triggering of AI evaluation for individual subjective responses.
*   Storage of AI-generated marks and feedback.
*   Role-specific viewing of results (Student: own results; Teacher: results for own exams; Admin: all results).
*   Basic API error handling and response standardization.

**Out of Scope (Initial Version):**

*   Real-time proctoring (webcam monitoring).
*   Advanced analytics and reporting dashboards.
*   Automatic grading of MCQs (though backend structure supports it, focus is on AI for subjective).
*   Support for other question types (e.g., Fill-in-the-blanks, Matching, Image-based).
*   Bulk import/export of questions or users.
*   Email/In-app notification system.
*   Course/Subject management features.
*   Mobile application.

**7. Methodology & Architecture:**

*   **Development Approach:** Likely follows an iterative or Agile approach, developing features module by module.
*   **Architecture:** Client-Server Architecture.
    *   **Frontend:** Angular 18 Single Page Application (SPA) using a modular structure (Core, Shared, Auth, Student, Teacher, Admin modules) for better organization and lazy loading. Communicates with the backend via REST API calls.
    *   **Backend:** Flask (Python) microframework providing a RESTful API. Handles business logic, database interaction, authentication/authorization, and external AI service calls.
    *   **Database:** PostgreSQL relational database accessed via SQLAlchemy ORM. Schema managed by Flask-Migrate.
    *   **API Communication:** Stateless RESTful API using JSON for data exchange. Secured by JWT.

**8. Key Features:**

*   **Role-Based Dashboards:** Tailored landing pages for Admins, Teachers, and Students showing relevant information.
*   **User Management (Admin):** Account verification, user listing (Teachers, Students), user deletion.
*   **Exam Management (Teacher):** Create, schedule, update, list, and delete exams.
*   **Question Management (Teacher):** Add, update, list, and delete MCQ, Short Answer, and Long Answer questions within exams.
*   **Exam Taking Interface (Student):** Clear display of questions, navigation, response input fields, and a countdown timer.
*   **Secure Submission (Student):** Robust handling of answer submission within the time limit.
*   **AI-Powered Evaluation (Admin Trigger):** Automated grading assistance for subjective questions using Gemini, providing marks and feedback.
